### Hi, I'm Rebecca!

My pronouns are she/her/hers.

I currently work at SUNY Oswego. I am the Associate Dean of [Graduate Studies](https://ww1.oswego.edu/graduate/) and a Professor of [Art and Design] (https://ww1.oswego.edu/art-and-design/). I'm also the co-host of the [Tea for Teaching Podcast](https://teaforteaching.com/)

I help students learn UI/UX and basic coding skills. My favorite area of research is Digital Accessibility.
